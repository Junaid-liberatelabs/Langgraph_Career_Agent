**Recommended Universities:**
IELTS 6.0 is a good start! To recommend universities and subjects, I need a bit more information.  Could you tell me:

1.  **What is your overall academic background?** (e.g., Bachelor's degree in Engineering, high school diploma, etc.)
2.  **What subject area are you interested in studying?** (e.g., Computer Science, Business, Arts, etc.)
3.  **What country are you interested in studying in?** (e.g., UK, Australia, Canada, USA, etc.)

Once I have this, I can provide more specific and helpful recommendations. I can also search for universities that accept an IELTS of 6.0 in your desired field and country.


**Recommended Subjects:**
IELTS 6.0 is a decent score, but it might limit your options for certain universities and programs. To give you the best recommendations, I need a little more information.  Can you tell me:

1.  **What subjects are you interested in studying?**
2.  **What is your highest level of education completed?**
3.  **What country are you interested in studying in?**

In the meantime, I can give you some general advice:

*   **Focus on countries where IELTS 6.0 is widely accepted.** This includes many universities in Australia, Canada, the UK, and some European countries. However, be aware that some universities in these countries may require a higher score for certain programs.
*   **Consider pathway programs.** Some universities offer pathway programs (also known as foundation programs or pre-sessional courses) that can help you improve your English language skills and prepare for academic study. These programs may accept students with IELTS 6.0.
*   **Research specific university requirements.** Always check the specific IELTS requirements for the programs and universities you are interested in. Requirements can vary widely.

Once I have the information requested above, I can provide more targeted recommendations.
