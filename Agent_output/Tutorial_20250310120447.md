# LangChain and LangGraph Tutorial

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to LangChain and LangGraph, covering their core concepts, usage, and implementation with Python code examples.

## LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It offers a modular and flexible approach to building complex LLM-powered applications by combining different components like models, prompts, chains, agents, and memory.

### Key Concepts:

* **LLMs:**  The core of LangChain, providing text generation and other language-related functionalities.
* **Prompts:** Instructions or contexts given to LLMs to guide their output.  LangChain offers tools to manage and optimize prompts effectively.
* **Chains:** Sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities.  They enable complex workflows and orchestration of multiple LLM interactions.
* **Agents:** Entities capable of making decisions about which tools to use, given a specific task. LangChain provides tools to define and manage agents.
* **Memory:**  Mechanisms to persist state between calls of a chain or agent. This allows for more context-aware and interactive applications.

### Code Example:

```python
query = "latest news on generative AI development"
print(default_api.duckduckgo_results_json(query=query))

```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple LangChain application that fetches the latest news on Generative AI development.  We use the `duckduckgo_results_json` tool from the `default_api` to perform this search.  This showcases the integration of external data sources within a LangChain application.



## LangGraph

LangGraph is a visual tool that allows developers to create, visualize, and manage LangChain flows interactively. It simplifies the process of building and experimenting with complex LLM workflows.

### Key Features:

* **Visual Flow Creation:** Drag-and-drop interface to design and connect different LangChain components.
* **Component Library:** Access to a wide range of pre-built LangChain components.
* **Interactive Debugging:**  Test and debug flows directly within the visual environment.
* **Code Generation:** Export the visual flow as executable Python code.


### Usage:

While LangGraph itself doesn't involve direct coding within its interface, it significantly streamlines the development process by providing a visual representation of the LangChain flow. The generated code can then be used as a starting point for further customization and integration.  LangGraph is invaluable for rapid prototyping and experimentation with different LangChain configurations.
